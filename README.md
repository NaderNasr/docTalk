# Getting Started with PokeDex

- Git clone the repo.
- Once Cloned access the root folder `doctalk` and run `npm install`.
- Access `./server` and run `npm install`.
- Make sure `node_modules` files are available for both the root folder (client) and the server folder.

- On the server terminal `cd server` and run `npm run start:server` to get the local server up and running.
- On the root folder also run `npm start` and go to your browser and access `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.
- To view the local API go to `http://localhost:4000/api/`.
